* Self-determination

Users should be able to move seamlessly between online services without interruption. Users should be able to chose a from a variety of services that work together with other services. Users should be able to change their mind about which service they use and take their data along with them in a convenient way.  

Users should have the freedom to determine the following about data generated while they use an online service: where data is sored, who has access to its and how it is used. They should also have the ability to share any part of their user data with any other user, organisation or service without constraint, manipulation or restriction of choice. Granularity of these decisions is key.

Online services including storage of data, identification online, and use of data for an application should always be interoperable with each other. Data should slot seamlessly from one Solid app or Pod to another without permission from each other. Solid app and Pod providers should be able to easily innovate by creating new apps or improving current apps, all while reusing existing data that was created by other apps. Unnecessary technical hurdles or business opportunities should not be used as an excuse to not provide interoperability.
