* Fairness

Online interactions should be fair for everyone involved both for consumption and creation i.e. the read-write web. While development may require education this should also be freely available and accessible to all.

The web should be available everywhere and should be indiscriminate in the way it operates and speaks to everyone. 

Users should not be subject to any bias, discrimination or missuse of their unique data. Everyone should be given equal access to their data and the same privileges in terms of how they manage their data, how they share it and the value extracted from it. Personal data usage should not infringe on the freedom or rights of any individual be they the owner of that data or associated to it.
