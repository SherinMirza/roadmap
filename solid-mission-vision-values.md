Users should be able to move seamlessly between online services without interruption. Users should be able to chose a from a variety of services that work together with other services. Users should be able to change their mind about which service they use and take their data along with them in a convenient way.  

Users should have the freedom to determine the following about data generated while they use an online service: where data is sored, who has access to its and how it is used. They should also have the ability to share any part of their user data with any other user, organisation or service without constraint, manipulation or restriction of choice. Granularity of these decisions is key.
