# Roadmap

## Ideas for Roadmap: 
* [Babies of 2020](https://www.mitzilaszlo.org/publications/babiesof2020): the first piece of data a person generates is the ultrasound from their pregant mother. This is also a piece of data that is commonly shared socially as an announcement that a baby will be born. Babies of 2020 is a concept of providing a Solid compatible for the ultrasound of a baby along with the birth certificate. As the baby grows older more Solid compatible solutions could be provided for key life events such as joining a school, finding a job, opening a bank account etc. 
* the existence of good, usable apps; for that we need:
  * app developers; for that we need:
    * an unambiguous 0.8 spec with at least two working implementations
    * data conventions
    * tools and docs for app developers
    * a well-governed process to guarantee Solid stays open for permissionless innovation
    * users willing to use and test new apps
* usable access control; for that we need:
  * data scopes; for that we need:
    * a working group that adds those to the 0.9 spec
    * implementation in both server implementations
* efficient access to the web of data; for that we need:
  * apps that use background sync
  * research into indexing and caching strategies
* ability to move your pod from one pod provider to another without too much hassle; for that we need:
  * pod providers that allow using your own domain name
  * instructions on how to host your webid on a static server, outside your pod
  * app that can handle contacts with multiple frequently changing WebID's
